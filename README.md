# Groupon Chrome extension
This extension will activate when users navigate to websites for which Groupon has offers.

It will show the offers in the pop-up, and when clicked, it will open them in a new tab.

### Installation
- Clone the project
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Activate the *Developer Mode*
- Click _Load Unpacked_
- Select the cloned directory
- Use at will

### Future implementations
- Add tracking
- Add the possibility to login so that we can show user specific offers
- Add a `More...` when offers are more than 2 or 3
- Add geolocation to the BE calls so that websites and offers are specific for each country
- Replicate the project for other browsers
